# Tuky
The platform for localize stuffs used by workspace's user group.

The idea is to have a centralized way for knowing where the items are, imagine the scenario when you need to share a device in a office to test mobile apps and you need to use it but don't know where it is or who has it, you just will need to search for the device in your workspace using Tuky and there you go!
